Artificial Intelligence Project: American Sign Language (ASL) Alphabet Recognition

Project Description:
This project aims to develop an artificial intelligence system capable of recognizing and interpreting the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet. The system can identify ASL letters from images uploaded by users.

Key Features:
Sign Recognition: The system is able to detect and recognize ASL letters with high accuracy from the uploaded images.
Friendly User Interface: Users can easily upload hand gesture images and get recognition results in text form.

Technology Used:

Python and TensorFlow: Used for machine learning model development.
Flask: Web framework used to build interactive user interfaces.
Kaggle: For data exploration, model training, and result analysis.

Goals and Benefits:
Improving Communication: Helps individuals unfamiliar with ASL to understand and communicate with ASL users.
Education: Be a learning tool for those who want to learn ASL.
Inclusivity: Promotes inclusivity by providing tools that facilitate interaction between the deaf and non-deaf communities.
Expected Outcome:
This project is expected to provide an effective and efficient solution to recognize ASL letters from images, facilitating communication and education in sign language. With further implementation and development, this system can be integrated into broader applications, such as real-time translators or interactive learning aids.
